# TSQL-SampleCode
Sample T-SQL code utilizing the Northwind database. The questions are taken from SQL Practice Problems by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik. 

## Organization
The problems and solutions are organized into Jupyter Notebooks, each containing a set of questions that gradually increase in difficulty. Each notebook includes a detailed description of the problem or challenge, followed by my T-SQL code that can be used to solve it, as well as the resulting output. Where possible, I attempt to include multiple SQL solutions to one problem.
